# BookstoreApp

A simple bookstore application on desktop written in Java. It has a GUI which I made using JavaFX 8 library and FXML.
For storing data it uses SQLite3.

It was a school project for actually practicing the MVC pattern and get the idea how ~~terrible~~ awesome is the process of building a GUI.
Originally it was written for Oracle Database, but that's a monster...

## Would you like to try?

1. Download the [BookstoreApp.zip](dist/BookstoreApp.zip) package
